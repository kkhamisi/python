# Week 1: Clean the Airbnb Dataset (and Deploy It!)

Welcome to the first week's project for *Python for Data Science*!

This week's lecture and material on CoRise showed you how to effectively use NumPy to clean, read, and process data. Now having looked at the data, you might be thinking to yourself, "Why were these these latitude and longitude columns included in the dataset for Week 1?" 🤷 We'll put this data to use in this project, and also get a preview of how you will be expected to make forecasts of your own with this data at the end of this course! For this week's project, we are going to use that location data to make an interactive app. We hope this project gets you excited for what's to come in following weeks 🙌🙌! 

But first, let's process our data! 

---

*All the information required to finish this week's project can be found by clicking on the **"Related section on CoRise"**-link. If you are unable to do so, please reach out to us on Slack!*

## Downloading the Dataset

You will need to download some prerequisite packages in order to run all the code below. Let's install them!
"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %%capture
# !pip install numpy pandas streamlit gdown currencyconverter

import numpy as np

# For readability purposes, we will disable scientific notation for numbers
np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)

"""Taking a look at the `import` statements below shows that we are using a mix of Python out-of-the-box 🎁 libraries (os, shutil, gzip) alongside some custom ones (gdown, numpy). Gdown allows us to download files from Google Drive, which is where we saved our modified dataset. Gzip helps us unzip downloaded files. Shutil copies the downloaded files in the right location, and we'll use os to delete unneeded files."""

"""## Preprocessing the Dataset
Getting this particular dataset loaded is a tad bit different from what we learned in this week's content. This time we only have 1 CSV file, so we do not need to merge it. So because there is no need to merge we can move right into data preprocessing!

#### Task 1: Find your delimiter

"""Next, output the first four columns for inspection to see if you've got the data formatted how you'd like."""

# my_data[:, :4]
print(my_data)

"""Awesome! But notice our data is aligned a little differently than how we saw in the course materials. It's like we shifted our dataset by 90 degrees! You'll have to fix this a little bit later.

#### Task 2: Clean it up

[*\[Related section on CoRise\]*](https://corise.com/course/python-for-data-science/v2/module/merging-datasets#corise_cl9k2znzw000t3b6poq4jg6o5)

In order for your calculations to run correctly, you need to have only the "relevant" numbers/entries present in your dataset. This means no headers, footers, redudant IDs, etc. Can you remove the first row and column, since you won't be needing them? Verify your work by again by printing out the first four columns.
"""

As stated previously, our dataset is shifted by 90 degrees. Let's shift it another 90 degrees to get it back to how we'd expect, which is in a much more readable format. Please find in the course material in CoRise the correct operation that you'd need to use to do that. Again, verify your work by printing out of the first five rows.

"""Now that all data is loaded properly, let's clean it up a bit like we did before by removing string characters and setting the right type 😁.

#### Task 4: That character is not appropriate

[*\[Related section on CoRise\]*](https://corise.com/course/python-for-data-science/v2/module/merging-datasets#corise_cl9k3ccc7001v3b6pz8a29ekr)

What if you were to visit Amsterdam? You'd probably want to have your Airbnb close to your favorite spot!

#### Task 10: Choose your location

Look up a place you'd like to visit in Amsterdam's city center, along with its longitude and latitude. We want to save this for choosing an Airbnb listing to our liking. You can get coordinates from [Google](https://www.google.com/) by searching like so:

Imagine Airbnb Amsterdam decided to deviate from Airbnb Global and provide a feature on their website that showed the best listings for you based on the locations you were planning to visit. Wouldn't it make sense to choose a place to stay in a location closest to where you're likely to go most often?

So this is the most exciting part: You're going to calculate just that! You will limit your results to your favorite location in Amsterdam (as chosen above) and the surrounding available Airbnb listings using math and NumPy!

We've already provided you with the math calculations down below. Please make sure to run that method!

You'll have to use this method in a `for` loop or by using [`np.vectorize`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.vectorize.html) as was shown on CoRise.

## Prep the Dataset for Download!


Now that we've created a function to calculate the distance in meters for every Airbnb listing, we'll perform this calculation on the entire dataset and add the outputs to the matrix as a new column.

Next to that, we'll add another column that contains only ones and zeros to represent the "color" of an entry/row. This column can be used later if you want to turn this dataset into an app using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). This resource is great for when you want to translate your Python projects into an interactive website. More on that in the next section.

As you'll see from the code, we'll also add our favorite location as an entry/row. (We've selected the coordinates of the Rijksmuseum. Feel free to change it to your favorite location in Amsterdam).

**Participants such as yourselves often want to use the weekly CoRise projects for their portfolios. To facilitate that, we've created this section. It might seem like a lot, but it's actually just following instructions and copy-pasting. Reach out on Slack if you get stuck!** 

You will make an app that visualizes the dataset as a DataFrame and as a geographic visualization like:

- **Listing_id**: Ignored for visualization purposes
- **Price**: Hovering over a blue/red dot displays in **bold** the price at the top
- **Latitude**: Used to plot the blue/red dot on the map
- **Longitude**: Used to plot the blue/red dot on the map
- **Meters from favorite point**: Hovering over a blue/red dot displays the number of meters from the blue point
- **Color**: Dependent on the category its assigned

To visualize this, we will again use a library called [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). For now you are not expected to know how Streamlit works, but you are expected to be able to copy-paste and follow instructions if you want to share this project as part of your portfolio!

We are going to use [Streamlit Share](https://share.streamlit.io/) to host your projects. It's a website that allows us to host our interactive projects for free online!

You will have to wait around 1-5 minutes, then an automatic hyperlink is generated for your new website. An example is this app:

```https://[GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME]-[GITHUB_REPOSITORY]-[RANDOM_6_LETTER_STRING].streamlit.app/```

We invite you to try and see if you can apply [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) to the project and potentially speed up some of these calculations. This is a tool commonly used in the industry to make code run faster. 

Another experiment you could try (if you have access to a GPU) is to see if running your code via [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) speeds up your implementation. A great way to start is described in [this post](https://medium.com/data-analysis-center/a-practical-approach-to-speed-up-python-code-numba-numpy-cupy-65ab52526ad4).

Lastly, Can't get enough of Numpy 🥰? Try [this tutorial on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/legendadnan/numpy-tutorial-for-beginners-data-science/notebook), which covers some more interesting NumPy uses.

# Next Up?
Next week we will delve into Pandas, a Python library focused on tabular data instead of matrixed data. We'll show you how those are different, and how you'll be able to harness Pandas for your machine learning journey with Python!
